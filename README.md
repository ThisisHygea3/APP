Hygea3 is a Peer-to-Peer Decentralized Medical Storage Network. Hygea allows you to share your medical information to providers while traveling, changing doctors, and in emergencies.

Users can upload their own medical files and give exclusive access to hospitals, medical providers of their choice. All the files are restricted with access control.
